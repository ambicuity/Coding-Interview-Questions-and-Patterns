## Introduction to Graphs

Graphs are versatile data structures consisting of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. They can represent relationships, networks, paths, and many real-world scenarios. Graph algorithms are fundamental in computer science and appear frequently in coding interviews, covering traversal, shortest paths, connectivity, and optimization problems.

### Key Concepts

**Basic Terminology:**
- **Vertex/Node**: Individual element in the graph
- **Edge**: Connection between two vertices
- **Adjacent**: Two vertices connected by an edge
- **Path**: Sequence of vertices connected by edges
- **Cycle**: Path that starts and ends at the same vertex
- **Connected**: All vertices reachable from each other

**Types of Graphs:**
1. **Directed vs Undirected**: Edges have direction or not
2. **Weighted vs Unweighted**: Edges have associated costs or not
3. **Connected vs Disconnected**: All vertices reachable or not
4. **Cyclic vs Acyclic**: Contains cycles or not (DAG)

### Common Patterns

1. **Graph Traversal** - DFS and BFS exploration
2. **Shortest Path** - Finding minimum cost paths
3. **Cycle Detection** - Identifying cycles in graphs
4. **Topological Sort** - Ordering vertices in DAG
5. **Connected Components** - Finding isolated groups
6. **Bipartite Testing** - Two-coloring problems
7. **Minimum Spanning Tree** - Connecting all vertices with minimum cost

### When to Use Graphs

- Social networks and relationships
- Transportation and routing problems
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Web crawling and link analysis
- Game states and decision trees
- Network flow problems

### Graph Representation

**Adjacency List:** Most common, space-efficient
```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D'],
    'C': ['A', 'D'],
    'D': ['B', 'C']
}
```

**Adjacency Matrix:** Good for dense graphs
```python
# For n vertices, create n x n matrix
matrix = [[0, 1, 1, 0],
          [1, 0, 0, 1],
          [1, 0, 0, 1],
          [0, 1, 1, 0]]
```

## Interview Tips for Graphs

ðŸ’¡ **Key Interview Tips:**

1. **Choose representation** - Adjacency list vs matrix based on problem
2. **Consider direction** - Directed vs undirected affects algorithm
3. **Track visited nodes** - Prevent infinite loops in traversal
4. **Think about edge cases** - Disconnected graphs, self-loops, cycles
5. **Understand time complexity** - V + E for most algorithms

### Implementation Examples

**Depth-First Search (DFS):**
```python
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    
    visited.add(start)
    print(start)
    
    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
    
    return visited
```

**Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)
    
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        print(vertex)
        
        for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return visited
```

**Detect Cycle in Directed Graph:**
```python
def has_cycle(graph):
    WHITE, GRAY, BLACK = 0, 1, 2
    color = {node: WHITE for node in graph}
    
    def dfs(node):
        if color[node] == GRAY:
            return True  # Back edge found
        
        if color[node] == BLACK:
            return False
        
        color[node] = GRAY
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if dfs(neighbor):
                return True
        
        color[node] = BLACK
        return False
    
    for node in graph:
        if color[node] == WHITE:
            if dfs(node):
                return True
    
    return False
```

**Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm):**
```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]
    
    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight
            
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))
    
    return distances
```

**Count Islands (DFS on Grid):**
```python
def count_islands(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    count = 0
    
    def dfs(r, c):
        if (r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or 
            grid[r][c] == '0'):
            return
        
        grid[r][c] = '0'  # Mark as visited
        
        # Explore all 4 directions
        dfs(r + 1, c)
        dfs(r - 1, c)
        dfs(r, c + 1)
        dfs(r, c - 1)
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == '1':
                count += 1
                dfs(i, j)
    
    return count
```

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

1. **Infinite Loops**
   - Always track visited nodes
   - Handle cycles properly

2. **Direction Confusion**
   - Be clear about directed vs undirected
   - Add edges in correct direction

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Be careful with deep recursion in DFS
   - Consider iterative approaches for large graphs
